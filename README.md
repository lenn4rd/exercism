# Solutions for exercism.io

These are my solutions for the exercises at [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

Think my solutions could be improved? Please nit-pick on Exercism! I'd really appreciate any kind of feedback and that's why I started doing the exercises. You can find all my submissions [on my profile page](http://exercism.io/lenn4rd).

I've left the tests and the READMEs in here as a reference. They might be outdated, so make sure to [fetch the exercises](http://help.exercism.io/fetching-exercises.html).
